# calorAI</br>
The basic idea of CalorAI is to make it easy for everyone to know what they're eating. We used Google’s Gemini 1.5 flash Vision, a pre-trained model, to recognize food items in photos and provide details like calories and macronutrients. You just upload a picture, and the app gives you a detailed breakdown of your meal.The core of our app is this powerful model that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify foods and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to describe the nutritional content. We didn’t have to train the model ourselves, which saved a lot of time. We did tweak some things to make the results clearer and more user-friendly.Well, we're really proud of what we've built and think it can help a lot of people make healthier choices.</br> try it here "https://calorai.streamlit.app/" !!
